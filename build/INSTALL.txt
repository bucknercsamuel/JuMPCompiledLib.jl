By default, install.sh installs files under $HOME/.local.

To install, optionally set the following environment variables and run
install.sh.

  NAME         project name (default: jclib)
  SOURCE_DIR   directory whose contents to copy (default: jclib)
  PREFIX       destination prefix (default: $HOME/.local)

Examples:

  $ ./install.sh                         # install in ~/.local
  $ SOURCE_DIR=jclib install.sh      # install in ~/.local (jclib is the default)
  $ PREFIX=/usr/local ./install.sh       # install directly in /usr/local (no symlinks)

To uninstall, make sure PREFIX and NAME have the same values used during
install and run uninstall.sh.
